The [Dad Jokes API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) includes an endpoint for [getting a random dad joke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api#fetch-a-random-dad-joke). Your task is to build an app using React that displays a random dad joke from the API with the push of a button!

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with: 

-   React and React components
-   State and props
-   The component life-cycle methods
-   Working with an API

## Instructions

1.  Clone this repository.
1.  Change (`cd`) into the new directory.
1.  `npm i`
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

The starter code provided here is based on Create React App. 

## Requirements

Your application should display a large button that, when clicked, fetches a random dad joke from the Dad Jokes API and displays it to the user. It should look as similar as possible to the image provided below. You could, as a bonus, have a random dad joke appear when the app loads.

## Even Bigger Bonus

Build a queue that stores the 10 most recently retrieved dad jokes! Additionally, add some buttons that let you scroll back and forth through the queue.

You should have:

* One button to get a new joke (append to queue). If there are 10+ jokes in the queue, drop the oldest one.
* One button to advance to the next joke.
* One button to revert to the previous joke.
