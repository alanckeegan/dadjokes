The [Dad Jokes API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) includes an endpoint for [getting a random dad joke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api#fetch-a-random-dad-joke). Your task is to build an app using React that displays a random dad joke from the API with the push of a button!

To help get you started, we added a linter, `reactstrap`, and a few other dependencies to help you along your way.

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with the following: 

-   React and React components
-   State and props
-   Component life-cycle methods
-   APIs

## Instructions

1.  Clone this repository.
1.  Change (`cd`) into the new directory.
1.  `npm i`
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

The starter code provided here is based on Create React App. 

## Requirements

Your application should display a large button that, when clicked, fetches a random dad joke from the Dad Jokes API and displays it to the user. It should look as similar as possible to the image provided below.

[Your app should looks something like this!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N_aFEN18nua-42HhgessxE3XwnqBbz-K/view)

## Yoga Stretch Goals 

* Have a random dad joke appear on app load.
* After you write your components in traditional React, then rewrite functional components using `Hooks`. 
* Try using `useEffect` instead of the component traditional lifecycle methods.
* Give your app some style!


## Crossfit Stretch Goals

Build a queue that stores the 10 most recently retrieved dad jokes! Additionally, add some buttons that let you scroll back and forth through the queue.

You should have:

* One button to get a new joke (append to queue). If there are 10+ jokes in the queue, drop the oldest one.
* One button to advance to the next joke.
* One button to revert to the previous joke.
